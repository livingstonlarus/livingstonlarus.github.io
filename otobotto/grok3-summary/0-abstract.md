# Abstract

Ōtobotto is an innovative AI-driven platform designed to address the rigorous demands of enterprise software engineering. It introduces three key advancements: **(1)** a decentralized swarm coordination protocol enabling multiple specialized agents to collaborate in parallel, **(2)** a hierarchical memory system with adaptive token optimization, and **(3)** an enterprise-grade verification workflow integrating Git-based version control, test-driven development, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)-aligned sustainability practices. A KPI-driven dashboard provides real-time observability and control over the development process, ensuring alignment with project goals and sustainability metrics. By leveraging recent AI model advancements and a focus on progressive autonomy, Ōtobotto aims to streamline development, enhance maintainability, and set a new standard for responsible, efficient software engineering in a competitive global landscape.
