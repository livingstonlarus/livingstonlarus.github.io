# Preliminary Evaluation and Future Considerations

Preliminary tests, such as the Runic experiment, validate Ōtobotto’s approach. Kubernetes was used to manage pods for running and orchestrating agents—not for deploying the application itself—demonstrating scalability. QStash was implemented for efficient task queuing, enhancing performance. These results suggest Ōtobotto can handle enterprise-scale projects, though further evaluation is needed to refine its capabilities and ESG alignment.

Future considerations include expanding real-world testing and optimizing adaptive track management to ensure consistent efficiency across diverse use cases.
