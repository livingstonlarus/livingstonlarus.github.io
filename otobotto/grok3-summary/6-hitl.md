# Human-in-the-Loop and Progressive Autonomy

Ōtobotto blends human oversight with progressive autonomy, ensuring flexibility and reliability. During development, humans guide high-level decisions via the dashboard, while agents handle execution. Post-release, Ōtobotto takes on **long-term maintenance and user support**, managing tasks like ticket resolution and system updates. It processes user inputs, evaluates them, and acts accordingly, keeping projects responsive and current.

This human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach evolves into greater autonomy over time, reducing manual intervention while maintaining quality. By supporting both initial development and ongoing maintenance, Ōtobotto ensures sustainable, user-centric software solutions.
